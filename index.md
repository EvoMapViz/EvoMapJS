# Quickstart

This tutorial provides a quick overview about the different tools available in EvoMapJS.

To install the app *locally*:

- Clone the github repo.
- Open the terminal and navigate inside the terminal to its local repository (`cd local_path_of_githb_repo`).
- Run `npm i` (this will installs `Node.js` module dependencies for `React`).
- Run `npm start` (the will starts the local server environment for the app).
- The app should open automatically in your default browser. 
If it does not, open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
