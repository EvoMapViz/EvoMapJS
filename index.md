# Quickstart

This tutorial provides a quick overview about the different tools available in EvoMapJS.

In general, input data is expected in the form of either higher-dimensional feature vectors, or in the form of pairwise relationships.

Given such data, evomap provides a flexible set of tools to process and manipulate the data, map it to lower-dimensional space, and to evaluate and explore the resultant maps.
